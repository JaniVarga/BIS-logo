This little program is designed to make things easier for production/technicians.
The script prints a predefined number of labels with the BIS logo. 
From the script, via a graphical interface, it is possible to control the position of the BIS logo by changing the top label value. 
The script sends the program, written in the predefined zpl code, to the Zebra printer.
The Zebra printer is a 110Xi4 type 24 dot/mm (600dpi) cutter.
The label size is 16x11 mm.
